# Minesweeper
## 3 implementations
|Implementation | Name |
| --- | --- |
| Console | Minesweeper |
| Gui (horrible) | Winsweeper |
| Custom (Not Implemented completely) | Sdlsweeper|

Each implementation demonstrates gameplay, minus the SDL version of it. This is mainly tested on Windows 10, therefore it should compile and work on Windows 11.

## Console
This is the first version that was written for Milestones 1-3. This demonstrates the gameplay and helps understand board and bomb implementation.

## GUI
This is the second version that was written for Milestones 4-7. This is not the best gameplay because of how the buttons are working. Instead of passing off delegation, a timer iterates through all the buttons, and is slow.

## SDL
This version was not intended to be a part of the Milestones. Instead, this is the side project that was inspired by Professor Jason Jazzar of Grand Canyon University's C# II class. Because of him, midway through the Milestones, he encouraged me to challenge myself to see what I really am capable of. So far, this is a sign of me going back into game development and giving it another shot.

## Compilation
To compile this project, it's simple, just open the solution. Please check the [requirements](#requirements) section to ensure all libraries are restored.

## Requirements
* Windows 10
* [SharpSDL2](https://github.com/GeorchW/SharpSDL2)

## Issues

## Contributors
Contributors are welcome as this is no longer a class assignment. The SDL version needs work, but the other implementations can be used as references as needed.
